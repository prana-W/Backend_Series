# URL Handling in Node.js

- Latest versions of Node.js does include the `url` module by default.
- However, just to be safe, we install the package.
- URL Parser provides the `url` module to parse and manipulate URLs.
- Therefore, we do `npm install url` to install the `url` module and use that to parse and get information about the URL.

REMEMBER: SETUP nodemon!!!!
